                By accessing and using the Functionality, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of Digital Assets. You further understand that the markets for these Digital Assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Solana are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your Digital Assets, or any Digital Assets you acquire, including through a third-party exchange accessed
                via the Swapper may lose some or all of their value and you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and/or significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and that we cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Site or Functionality.
                <br /><br />
                The Site and Functionality and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more government or regulatory inquiries or government or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of TowneSquare to continue to make its proprietary software, and thus, could impede or limit your ability to continue to use the Functionality.
                <br /><br />
                You understand and acknowledge that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking and other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update TowneSquare-developed smart contracts related to the Functionality to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not reflect a binding commitment and does not in any way guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Functionality.
                <br /><br />
                You understand that the Solana and the Aptos blockchain (and all other networks with which the Functionality may be compatible) remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Functionality in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Solana blockchain is variable and may increase at any time, thereby impacting any activities taking place on the Solana blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased prices for using the Functionality.
                <br /><br />
                You acknowledge that the Functionality is subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Site or Functionality. This warning and others TowneSquare provides in these Terms in no way evidence or represent any on-going duty to alert you of the potential risks of utilizing the Functionality or accessing the Site.
                <br /><br />
                Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Site and the Functionality, that intention does not reflect a binding commitment, and the Site and other information available when using the Functionality may not be accurate, complete, error- free or current. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it in any manner, and all decisions based on such information contained on the Site or made available through the Functionality are your sole and absolute responsibility. No representation of any kind or nature is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing or other information distributed via the Site or Functionality. Pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.
                <br /><br />
                Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Functionality does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies,
                and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset and the use and availability of any particular blockchain.
                <br /><br />
                Use of the Functionality, in particular for trading Digital Assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Functionality are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Functionality at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets can be substantial (all the more so if you are leveraged). You should, therefore, carefully assess whether such trading is suitable and appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Site and Functionality, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Functionality or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Functionality, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Functionality for performing Digital Asset transactions.

                You understand that TowneSquare and the Swapper are not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC, or any other financial regulatory authority (whether in the United States or elsewhere).
